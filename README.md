## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- No CSS framework
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While I use this project as a warmup to get back to coding, I end up use something I never use before. Using height as a breakpoint, below is the code. 

```css
media (max-height: 800px) {
	.wrapper {
		padding: 12px 24px;
	}
}
```

I use this so the card doesn't touch the top or bottom screen on some device.
